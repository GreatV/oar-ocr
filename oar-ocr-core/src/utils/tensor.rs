//! Tensor utility functions.
//!
//! This module previously contained utility functions for converting between Rust vectors
//! and ndarray tensors. These functions have been removed as they were not being used.
//!
//! Direct usage of `ndarray::Array*<f32>` types is now preferred throughout the codebase.
