# Cargo configuration for oar-ocr

# Windows MSVC target configuration
# This fixes the LNK2038 error: Runtime library mismatch between dependencies
# By default, some dependencies (esaxx-rs) may use static CRT (/MT) while others
# (clipper2c-sys) use dynamic CRT (/MD). This configuration ensures consistent
# runtime library linking by forcing all dependencies to use static CRT (/MT).
#
# The +crt-static feature tells rustc to link the C runtime statically,
# which ensures all native dependencies use the same runtime library.
