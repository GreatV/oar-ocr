# OAR (ONNXRuntime And Rust) OCR

A comprehensive OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library, built in Rust with ONNX Runtime for efficient inference.

## Acknowledgments

This project builds upon the excellent work of several open-source projects:

- **[ort](https://github.com/pykeio/ort)**: Rust bindings for ONNX Runtime by pykeio. This crate provides the Rust interface to ONNX Runtime that powers the efficient inference engine in this OCR library.

- **[PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR)**: Baidu's awesome multilingual OCR toolkits based on PaddlePaddle. This project utilizes PaddleOCR's pre-trained models, which provide excellent accuracy and performance for text detection and recognition across multiple languages.
